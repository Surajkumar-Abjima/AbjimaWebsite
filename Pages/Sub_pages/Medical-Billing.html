                            their medical billing and coding processes. These issues were having a negative impact on
                            their revenue cycle, as the complexity of the tasks involved, coupled with the high
                            likelihood of human errors and the heavy administrative burden, were all contributing
                            factors. The client was struggling to stay on top of their billing and coding procedures,
                            and as a result, they were losing out on potential revenue as well as experiencing lost time
